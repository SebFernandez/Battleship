# Battleship 

Might be with bugs, I will check soon if there are serious bugs. I'm not with much time and to be constant with the code has been difficult.

First of all, I wanted to have the game running. The next step is to set up an AI, just very simple.

EDIT 23/10/16: 
* Many bugs had been solved. Basics of AI had been implemented for completing the board. 
* Next step is to set the AI to play against a human.
