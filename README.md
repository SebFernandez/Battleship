# Battleship 

First big project for me. The task is to code a battleship that can be played by two players or setting an AI which plays agains a player.

May be with bugs, I don't have much time to be constant due to the University, if any suggestions appear I will apreciate it.

EDIT 23/10/16: 
* Many bugs had been solved. Basics of AI had been implemented for completing the board. 
* Next step is to set the AI to play against a human.

EDIT 29/10/16:
* Function of checking for ships sinked is running.
* **You can play PVP (Player vs Player) now.**
