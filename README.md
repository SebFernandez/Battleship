# Battleship 

First big project for me. The task is to code a battleship that can be played by two players or setting an AI which plays against a player.

May be with bugs, I don't have much time to be constant due to the University, if any suggestions appear I will apreciate it.

- [X] Menu.
- [X] Have two boards filled without problems.
- [X] Ready to play PVP.
- [X] AI fills the board.
- [X] Ready to play PVC --> [On this commit!](https://github.com/Zeby95/Battleship/commit/abcc909054657340c5f60325ddb82b07636c456f)
- [ ] Ready to spectate CVC.

EDIT 23/10/16: 
* Many bugs had been solved. Basics of AI had been implemented for completing the board. 
* Next step is to set the AI to play against a human.

EDIT 29/10/16:
* Function of checking for ships sinked is running.
* **You can play PVP (Player vs Player) now.** 

EDIT 30/10/16:
* Added CPU vs CPU, the function of filling the board for both AI runs but there is a big bug for the function of the game, I didn't found the bug yet.
